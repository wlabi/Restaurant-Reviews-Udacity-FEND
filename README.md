* [x] Use of JavaScript arrays for data manipulation
* [x] Use of JavaScript timing events (setTimeout() and setInterval())
* [x] Use of functions (callback functions, arrow functions, IIFEs)
* [x] Creation and use of modals/popups
* [x] DOM manipulation:
  * [x] Listening for and then handling events
  * [x] Selecting and manipulating DOM elements
* [x] Use of Chrome DevTools
